# PublishLab Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026

## Fair Use Policy

PublishLab's "Unlimited" plans are designed to support typical creator workflows while maintaining high-quality service for all users.

### Usage Guidelines

Our platform is optimized for the following usage patterns:

- **Artisan Tier ($14.99/month)**: Up to 50 manuscripts per month
- **Publisher Master Tier ($49/month)**: Up to 200 manuscripts per month

### Quality Management

To ensure consistent performance for all users, we monitor usage patterns. If your usage significantly exceeds the optimized guidelines:

1. **At 80% of guideline**: You'll receive a usage update notification
2. **At 100% of guideline**: You'll receive a power user alert
3. **At 120% of guideline**: We may temporarily reduce generation quality during peak usage to maintain speed

**Important**: We will NEVER block your access or stop your service. "Unlimited" means unlimited.

### High-Volume Users

If you consistently exceed our guidelines, we'll:
- Contact you to understand your needs
- Offer custom enterprise pricing options
- Ensure you have the resources needed for your workflow

### What "Quality Reduction" Means

During high-volume periods, we may:
- Use faster AI models (Flux Schnell instead of Flux Dev)
- Reduce inference steps (4 steps instead of 28)
- Prioritize speed over maximum quality

Your content will still be professional and usable, just optimized for speed.
